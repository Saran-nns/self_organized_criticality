# Neural Avalanche Analysis
Criticality analysis in self organizing networks using avalanche, branching factors and power law 


## Workflow:
- [x] Avalanche size, interval, duration
- [x] Power laws (Zipf's law) for avalanche size, interval, duration
- [x] Exponent Estimate and Uncertainity
- [x] Plots: Histograms in Linear and Logscale
- [ ] Scaling function
- [ ] Exponent Relationships
- [ ] Branching Process
- [ ] Different Phase Transitions
- [ ] PiP package
- [ ] ReadMe
